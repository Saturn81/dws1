		<h2 id="center"> History of Sushi</h2>
			<p> The original type of sushi, known today as nare-zushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司,) was first made in Southeast Asia, possibly along what is now known as the Mekong River. The term sushi comes<br /> from an archaic grammatical form
			 no longer used in other contexts; literally, sushi means "sour-tasting", a reflection of its historic fermented origins. The oldest form of sushi in Japan,narezushi, still very closely resembles this process, wherein fish 
		 	is fermented via being wrapped in soured fermenting rice. The fish proteins break down via fermentation into their constituent amino acids. The fermenting rice and fish results in a sour taste and also one of the 
			 five basic tastes, called umami in Japanese. Contemporary Japanese sushi has little resemblance to the traditional lacto-fermented rice dish. 	<br /> <br />
 Originally, when the fermented fish was taken out of
		 	the rice, only the fish was consumed while the fermented rice was discarded. The strong-tasting and smelling funazushi, a kind of narezushi made near Lake Biwa in Japan, resembles the traditional fermented dish.
		 	Beginning in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) of Japan, vinegar was added to the mixture for better taste and preservation. The vinegar accentuated the rice's sourness and was known to increase its shelf life, 
			 allowing the fermentation process to be shortened  and eventually abandoned. In the following centuries, sushi in Osaka evolved into oshi-zushi. <br /> <br />The seafood and rice were pressed using wooden (usually bamboo)
			 molds. By the mid 18th century, this form of sushi had reached Edo (contemporary Tokyo).
			 The contemporary version, internationally known as "sushi", was created by Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858) at the end of the Edo period in Edo. Sushi invented by Hanaya was an early form of fast food that
			 was not fermented (therefore prepared quickly) and could be conveniently eaten with one's hands.Originally, this sushi was known as Edomae zushi because it used freshly caught fish in the Edo-mae (Edo Bay or Tokyo Bay).<br /> <br /> Though the fish used in modern sushi no longer usually comes from Tokyo Bay, it is still formally known as Edomae nigirizushi.
			 The Oxford English Dictionary notes the earliest written mention of sushi in English in an 1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as "a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring". However, there is also mention of sushi in a Japanese-English dictionary from 1873,and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal Notes and Queries.

		<p> <i>We don't mind sharing how are sushi rolls are created. Enjoy our sushi rolls at home! <i> </p>
		
	
		<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
		
	
			<ul id="foodList">    
				<li>2 cups sushi rice</li>
				<li>2-3 nori sheets</li>
				<li>10 medium size shrimps</li>
				<li>.5 cup Tempura</li>
				<li>1 Avocado</li>
				<li>1 Cucumber (long and even) </li>
				<li>50gr Tobiko (flying fish roe)</li>
				<li>50gr BBQ'ed eel (sushi grade)</li>
			</ul>
	
	
		<h4>Steps</h4>
			<ol id=foodlist">
				<li>Mix the tempura with a little bit of water and stir until combined to a thick even mixture. </li>
				<li>Cut off shrimp tails, and dip the shrimps, one by one, in tempura mixture and deep fry for about 30 sec or until the outside gets golden-brownish. </li>
				<li>Leave one shrimp for each roll with the tail uncut to place sticking out of the dragon roll rear as if it was the dragon's tail.</li>
				<li>Slice the cucumber into long slices, and use a peeler to peal thin avocado layers.</li>
				<li>Spread the rice on the nori sheet, and flip it over the mat so that the rice is now facing upwards.</li>
				<li>Lay the avocado the cucumber sticks you have cut in advance, and line up some tempura shrimps and on top of that slices of eel. Roll it inside-out style and cut <br />the endings, but leave the rest whole for now.</li>
				<li>Elegantly, cover the top of the roll with the layers of avocado you made with the peeler, and use the bamboo mat to tighten it to the roll. </li>
				<li>Use a little spoon to carefully spread some Tobiko on the roll. You can cover the entire dragon roll with it, or just the top side - it's your call.</li>
				<li>Now you can cut, and reline the roll in a shape of a dragon. </li>
